# `andrewmcodes` Business Card

One of the first gems I ever released now updated for 2023. Whether I get fancy or stay simple, it's only job is to echo my info into the terminal.

Nothing fancy, which is one of my goals with picking this project back up. **No perfectionism here! âœ¨**

## Installation

There is 0 reason to install this anywhere but your local machine, and even that now is unecessary! ðŸŽ‰

Now that [rubygems/rubygems#6309](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/6309) has merged, you no longer have to install this gem to use it. Similarly to `npx`, you can run `gem exec andrewmcodes` and hopefully it will work. ðŸ¤ž

## Usage

Recommended usage is to run the following command:

```shell
gem exec andrewmcodes
```

On older versions of RubyGems, you can run the following command:

```shell
gem install andrewmcodes
andrewmcodes
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

I have automated releases set up with GitHub Actions, so I skip the `rake release` steps. To set up your own automated release workflow, check out [this tutorial I wrote on how I do it!](https://andrewm.codes/blog/automating-ruby-gem-releases-with-github-actions/)

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, but this is my personal playground so I may want to solve the issue my own way or not at all. If anything, I'd encourage you to fork this and build your own!
